# python-xmlparser

A simple and stupid xml parser.

## Scratch the Itch

Wanted to parse a html page to extract data about COVID19 info,
but xml-ElementTree was having issue. Also didnt have time to
cross check what is the best built-in xml parser module in python.

Also wanted to give a shot at creating a simple xml parser to get
my job done so created this.
